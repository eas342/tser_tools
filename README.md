Time Series Tools README
==========================================
This repository contains code for analyzing and reducing time series data.
It is primarily designed for analysis of exoplanet data.

The Time Series Helper & Integration Reduction Tool :code:`tshirt` is a general-purpose tool for time series science.
Its main application is to process raw data on exoplanet systems.
:code:`tshirt` can:

- Reduce raw data: flat field, bias subtract, gain correct, etc. This has been demonstrated to work with merged CCD images from Mont4K imager on the Kuiper-61 inch on Mt Bigelow, AZ.
- Extract Photometry
- Extract Spectroscopy
